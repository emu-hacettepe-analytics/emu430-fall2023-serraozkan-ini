Like what languages it works with and what is to be expected of Quarto.\nNext, he gives information on how they improved on the fundamentals of RMarkdown’s working process for literate programming. After explaining what goes on in the background when we publish a file with Quarto, he illustrates usage scenarios with some chunks of code.\nAfter elaborating on the perks that come with using Quarto (like adaptability with several editors) he concludes his talk by showing his gratitude to the development team.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
